1. Import the information for the analysis

X_train (Train sample with the measurements of sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope))
y_train (Code for the activity that performs the volunteer for train sample)
subject_train (Code for the volunteer in train sample)
X_test (Test sample with the measurements of sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope))
y_test (Code for the activity that performs the volunteer for test sample)
subject_test (Code for the volunteer in test sample)

2. Join data into groups x, y and subject (train and test)

3. Merge the groups created above into a data base 

4. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. Filter the base to extract the variables that contains “mean()” or “std()”

5. Assigns a clear description to the code of the activity to identify what were doing the volunteer

6. Give another name to the variables, this can be useful to everyone understands the information

7. Create a shorter data base that store the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
